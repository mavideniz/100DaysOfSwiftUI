### Welcome to 100 Days Of SwiftUI Challenge! 🚀
#### Current Challenge 10/100 - 30.06.2021

The **Playground** and **Playground2** folders contains swift practices learned in the first 15 days of the training.

The projects I will do in the coming days will be created in a new file with the project names.

I created this repo to follow my own 100 day challenge and share it with other people.

I also share each day of the challenge on my [instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/dogancanmavideniz/), you can follow it! If you want to join this challenge and be a study buddy, you can send a message. 🙋🏼‍♂️
